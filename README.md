This project uses data analysis techniques to efficiently determine ideal locations to deploy electric vehicle(EV) charging stations.Electric automobiles are here to stay and with the gradual advancement in battery technology and grid infrastructure, bolstered by a growing emphasis on renewable energy sources by governments across the globe- electric vehicle adoption has demonstrated aggressive growth in recent times. The global stock of electric cars doubled in the year 2016 as compared to its previous year. Countries such as Norway, The Netherlands, USA, Sweden and China are leading the race in the adoption of EVs and we are hoping to see India up there as well. The Research and development on technology around electric automobiles are a vital area of focus to emerging startups as well as established giants in the automobile industry. Â To support this new market demand, it is essential to have an efficient network of EV charging stations motivating consumers to prefer EVs over traditional petroleum fuel-based automobiles.
